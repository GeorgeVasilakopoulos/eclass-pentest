### Defences


#### CSRF 

Numerous CSRF vulnerabilities were detected, accross many different modules of the platform. More specifically, requests that were made through forms in the admin side were completely exposed to such attacks and, in some extreme cases, simple GET requests could be used to change the state of the server.

In order to patch these vulnerabilities, we implemeneted CSRF token authentication. All state changing forms should now contain a hidden 'token' field that was provided by the server through a non state-changing GET request, while state-changing GET requests should include the token in the URL.

Below is a list of most of the patched files/directories. In total 62 files were changed:

- ```modules/admin/change_user.php``` 
- ```modules/admin/listreq.php```: Prevented the status change of registration requests through CSRF.
- ```modules/admin/listusers.php```, ```modules/admin/search_user.php```: Prevents user searches through CSRF.

- ```modules/admin/multireguser.php```: Prevented the registration of multiple users through CSRF

- ```modules/admin/newuseradmin.php```: Prevented the registration of a new admin.

- ```modules/admin/password.php```: Prevented password change of users (or even admin).

- ```modules/admin/unreguser.php```: Prevented the deletion of an account.

- ```modules/admin/edituser.php```: Prevented altering user information.

- ```modules/admin/mailtoprof.php```: Prevented email sending.

- ```modules/admin/addfaculte.php```: Prevented the creation/deletion of a department/faculty

- ```modules/admin/adminannouncements.php```: Prevented creation/edit/removal of an admin announcement

- ```modules/admin/eclassconf.php```: Prevented submission of malicious configuration settings.

- ```modules/admin/listcours.php```: Prevented the submission of a search.

- ```modules/admin/delcours.php```: Prevented the deletion of a course.

- ```modules/admin/editcours.php```, ```modules/admin/infocours.php``` 

- ```modules/admin/infocours.php```: Prevented altering course information.

- ```modules/admin/addusertocours.php```: Prevented granting admin access to course.

- ```modules/admin/quotacours.php```: Prevented altering course quota.

- ```modules/announcements/announcements.php```: Prevented the submission of an announcement in a course.

- In ```modules/exercise/```,files: ```admin.php```, ```answer_admin_inc.php```, ```exercise.php```, ```exercise_admin.php```, ```question_admin.php```, ```question_list_admin.inc.php```, ```question_list_admin.inc.php```, ```question_pool.php```, ```statement_admin.inc.php```: Secured the exercise module of a course.


- In ```modules/course_info/```, files : ```course_create.php```,```delete_course.php```, ```refresh_course.php```, ```infocours.php```, ```restore_course.php```, ```course_tools.php```: Prevented course changing actions/ creation of course.

- In ```modules/agenda/agenda.php``` : ```agenda.php```: Prevented the creation of an event.

- In ```modules/document/``` : ```document.php```, ```upload.php```: Secured the document module from CSRF attacks.

- In ```modules/forum_admin/``` : ```forum_admin.php```: Prevented the creation of a category

- In ```modules/wiki/```: Secured the wiki module.

- In ```modules/phpbb/```: Secured the phpbb module.



#### XSS

In this version of the platform, there were many XSS vulnerabilities that could be exploited, both *stored* and *reflected*. Since most of the admin side is protected by CSRF token authentication, there were fewer *reflected* XSS vulnerabilites that could be exploited. These were some obscure cases where the request did not change the state of the server and therefore, did not require authentication.

- In places where user information (such as name, last name) was displayed, the output was not filtered for html characters. Therefore, if a user set malicious html code as personal info, this code would be executed in places where the personal info was displayed. Characteristic examples of such places are: 

  - listing of users (```/admin/listusers.php```) 
  - listing of teacher requests (```/admin/listreq.php```)
  - management of users in courses (```/user```)
  - admin information (such as statistics, 'last user registration' etc)
  - in the confirmation of deletion of a user (```admin/unreguser.php```)

- In the forum section of a course (```/modules/mathbb```), neither the users' credentials, nor their activity (posts/answers) was escaped for html characters. The navigation bar was also prone to attacks. 

- The conference section, for the same reason, was vulnerable to stored XSS attacks.

- In the assignment section, the users' comments was not sanitized - stored XSS vulnerability. Also, a reflected XSS attack could be triggered by setting malicious code as argument in ```&submission=```. Example: ```http://localhost:8001/modules/work/grade_edit.php?assignment=1&submission=></script><script>alert(1)</script><``` 

- The calendar (!) was also prone to reflected XSS attacks, by assigning malicious code to the ```&year=``` url argument. 

- The inactive course modules were also patched for stored XSS attacks



#### RFI/LFI

Furthermore, we came across a few cases where a user could upload a file that could either be executed by the server (php files, if requested through the url) or by the admin's browser (such as html files). These instances were located in the assignments and dropbox modules. The vulnerabilities, along with the security measures that we took were the following:

- When a user clicks on a file received from the dropbox module, the file immediately gets downloaded. We noticed that file types such html don't get downloaded and, instead, are displayed as pages in the browser. This is a hazard, since the files could contain malicious javascript code.

- We turned off directory listing (```conf/000-default.conf```) because this would allow the user to manually direct the server to execute uploaded php code. 

- When an assignment is submitted by a student, the submitted file gets uploaded in a 'secret' folder within ```courses/TMA***/work```. The problem was that the assigned name of the folder was the output of ```uniqid("")``` which is very predictable, since it is based upon the current time in microseconds (at the time of creation of the assignment). We chose to name the files using a much larger, random hexadecimal string, using ```bin2hex(openssl_random_pseudo_bytes())```. Dropbox files also get renamed similarly, so that they cannot be easily found through the url.

- Also, uploaded .php .html .js .css files get converted to .php_secure .html_secure .js_secure .css_secure respectively. 

#### SQL Injections




#### Other Security Measures

- We decided to add salt to the passwords, so that common passwords can't be decrypted through online databases.

- If the admin tries to change password through ```http://localhost:8001/modules/admin/edituser.php?u=1```, the page redirects to ```http://localhost:8001/modules/profile/password.php```. Previously, the admin could change his password through edituser without having to type his current password. This was a big risk because if someone managed to steal the cookie from the admin, they could simply change the password and gain permanent access.

- The deletion of a user also requires password verification. Previously, a user could be deleted simply by 'clicking the wrong link'.
